# Rossmann-Store-Sales-Forecast
Forecast Rossmann's future sales   Rossmann is Germany's largest supermarket for daily necessities and was founded in 1972. In the pharmaceutical retail sector, Rossmann now has more than 3,000 pharmacies in seven European countries. Currently, Rossmann store managers have the task of **forecasting their daily sales** six weeks in advance. Obviously, store sales are influenced by many factors, such as promotions, competition, holidays, seasonality and location, to name a few. Thousands of individual managers forecast sales based on their individual stores, and the accuracy of the results can vary greatly.  

Reliable sales forecasting enables store managers to create effective staff schedules that increase productivity and motivation, such as better alignment of supply chains and sound promotional and competitive strategies, with significant practical and strategic value. If Rossmann can be helped to create a powerful forecasting model, it will help warehouse managers to focus on what is most important to them: their customers and their teams. Therefore, in this project, Rossmann wanted to build machine learning models to predict 6 weeks of sales for 1115 stores across Germany with the given data.
